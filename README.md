# MineEnter
A FabricMC Mod.

Since in higher versions of Minecraft, only one Enter key can be bind to "Open Chat", but some players are accustomed to using two Enter keys that can open the chat bar, which makes them uncomfortable, so this Mod was developed.

# Usage
Ready-to-use, a "Secondary Open Chat" key binding will be added. It is bound to KP_ENTER by default and can be modified in the "Control".
